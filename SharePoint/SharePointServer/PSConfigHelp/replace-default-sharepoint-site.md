# Replace default SharePoint site

 **Summary:** Learn how to replace the default SharePoint site in SharePoint Server. 
  
When you perform an upgrade and an existing SharePoint product is already installed, a default SharePoint site might already exist on port 80.
  
If you are certain that the existing default SharePoint web site is not required, you can disable the existing site and create a new one on port 80, or you can choose a different port on which to host the new site .
