# Choose the server type

 **Summary:** Learn how to choose a server role type in SharePoint Server 2016. 
  
SharePoint farm administrators can define each server's role in a farm topology. The role of a server is specified when you create a new farm or join a server to an existing farm. SharePoint automatically configures the services on each server based on the server's role, and the performance of the farm is optimized based on that topology.
  
There are six pre-defined server roles you can choose. When choosing between the different server roles, you must consider planning, scalability, data storage, and configuration complexity.
  
For additional information about server role types, see [MinRole overview](/sharepoint/install/overview-of-minrole-server-roles-in-sharepoint-server).
