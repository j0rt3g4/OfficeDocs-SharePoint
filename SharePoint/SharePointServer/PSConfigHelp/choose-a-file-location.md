# Choose a file location

 **Summary:** Learn how to choose a file location for SharePoint Server. 
  
The file location indicates the path where the product will be installed. The default path for the file location is %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Office Servers. If this is an application server that contains index partitions for the search system, you can specify the path at which to store the index files. The default path for the data location is %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Office Servers\16.0\Data.
  
- To install to a different path, click **Browse** next to the first text box, and then select the path. 
    
- To change the location for the search index files, click **Browse** next to the second text box, and then select the path. 
    
> [!NOTE]
> If you are upgrading from another SharePoint product, the file locations cannot be changed .
