# Missing server side dependencies (SharePoint Server)

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-xxx-md.md)]
  
 **Rule Name:** Missing server side dependencies. 

 **Summary:** When you first deploy SharePoint Server 2016 this rule can generate false errors. To resolve this, update to the [August 2016 PU release](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53399).
  
Typically when you see this rule, it states that some Search service web parts are missing. If this is the case then you can ignore this message.
  
 **Cause:** This rule typically occurs when you have deployed the Search service in a SharePoint Server farm.
