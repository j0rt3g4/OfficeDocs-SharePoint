# Known Folder Move workshop

This workshop provides guidance on how you can roll out OneDrive Known Folder Move:

- Plan for common challenges
- Requirements for each deployment option
- Deploy using Active Directory and Group Policy objects, SCCM, or Intune
- Monitor device eligibility, known folder details, move status, and Group Policy object state

The workshop assumes that you've already set up core infrastructure (Active Directory, DNS, AD Connect, SCCM) and doesn't cover third-party tools or custom applications integration.
